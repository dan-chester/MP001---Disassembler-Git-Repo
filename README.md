CS 131 Machine Problem # 001
Diassembler/Assembler (Java Programming Language to Assembly Language and vice-versa)

=============================
How to use the Program:
1. As the program starts, you will be asked to choose between 1 or 2 (only) 
    - [1] Program will convert from Assembly to Java
    - [2] Program will convert Java to Assembly
    [1? / 2?] : (1 or 2)
2. Upon choosing one of the options, the program will ask to enter the directory/path of the file
  that will be converted.
    - Directory Input:  (e.g C:\this\path\to\file.asm or C:\this\path\to\file.java )
3. After entering the directory of the file that will be converted, the program will ask where do you want
  to produce the file.
    - Directory Output:  (e.g C:\this\path\to\output\folder) 
4. Then, the program will prompt if the file is already converted and look for the file in the directory 
  that you entered in Step 3.
